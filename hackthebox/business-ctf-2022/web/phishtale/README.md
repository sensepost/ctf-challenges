# web/phishtale

## brief

Recently we identified a host matching a threat actor's TLS certificate facing the public internet. It contains an open-source phishing kit builder, so we have the source of the application at hand. We need you to get access to their server so that we can uncover their campaigns. Note: The host uses an HTTP/2 protocol with a self-signed certificate, so you must visit the host with the https:// protocol and accept the self-signed certificate to access.

## notes

Full challenge lab available as a docker.
